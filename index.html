			<h2>Bio</h2>
			Areg Balayan was born in Yerevan, Armenia in 1980. He attended Igityan Art Institute's graphic arts division.
			After serving two years in Armenian military, he enrolled in Armenian agricultural academy and graduated
			from it in 2005. The same year he moved to the Stepanakert, capital of unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh republic,
			and started out as a freelance photographer for various institutions such as UN, UNIDO, YMCA, Armenia Fund,
			LA-based USC Shoah Foundation, and others. Photos that Balayan took for the UNDP-funded project “Strengthening
			of National Disaster Preparedness and Risk Reduction Capacities” were published in bi-lingual “VOX POPULI”
			photostory book. <br><br>

			Since the establishment of PAN Photo agency in 2009, Areg Balayan has been a staff photographer and a
			manager for the PAN’s Karabakh bureau. On numerous assignments for PAN, Balayan took images that later were
			published by Reuters, Al Jazzera, Daily Mail, Cbc.com, Eurasian.net, Fox News, and other outlets. <br><br>

			MOB., Balayan’s latest story, is exhibited until March 1, 2017 in Yerevan’s Mirzoyan Library and
			curated by Karen Mirzoyan, Magnum Foundation 2010 EF Grantee and a former MF Human Rights Fellow. It
			represents an existential journey through the war and human abandonment as seen by a photographer turned
			into a combatant and then to photographer back again. Drafted as a private into Karabakh Defence Army and
			placed at the most distant border outpost on April 2nd, 2016, when the frozen conflict between Armenia and
			Azerbajan started over again. Balayan, as he puts, “died”: he embraced the idea of his own non-existence in
			this world. And then he found the way out from this inhuman situation, “maybe the only way”, he reminds —
			to live for the sake of my younger brothers-in-arms, 18-years-old conscripts. At this point he’d regained
			myself — and started taking photos. He had no choice between the rifle and my camera — it was his duty to
			hold Kalashnikov. <br><br>

			Areg Balayan took part in Guymri Art Biennale in Armenia (2005) , Georgia’s Tbilisi photo festival (2013)
			and FotoIstanbul  Photography Contest (2015). He acquired professional skills of ambrotype photography at
			Misha Burlatsky master classes held in Saint Petersburg (2015).
